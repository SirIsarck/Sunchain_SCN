## SunChain

Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Solana

 

## Problem Statement

Millions of Africans lack reliable electricity.
Grid power is inconsistent, expensive, and centralized.
Rural communities depend on fuel generators that harm the environment.



## Our Solution — SunChain

SunChain is a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) connecting community solar hubs using Solana.

Each hub records energy data on-chain for transparency & trust.

Users pay via Solana smart contracts using stablecoins.



## Why Solana

Ultra-fast and low-cost micro energy payments

Real-time IoT data tracking via on-chain oracles

Scalable for millions of microgrid users



## How It Works

1. Communities install solar panels and IoT-enabled smart meters.


2. Energy data is transmitted to Solana and stored on-chain.


3. Users buy tokens or pay directly for electricity.


4. Revenue is distributed transparently among operators and investors.



## Impact

Provides clean and affordable power access

Creates new economic opportunities for rural tech operators

Demonstrates how blockchain can support real-world infrastructure



## Usage

Connect a Solana wallet (Phantom or Solflare)

Register a community solar hub

Monitor real-time energy data

Execute payments and revenue sharing through the smart contract



## Technical Stack

Blockchain: Solana

Smart Contracts: Rust (Anchor Framework)

Frontend: React / Next.js

IoT Data: On-chain data + IPFS storage

Token: SunToken (SCN) – SPL token on Solana



## Reward Mechanism

SunChain introduces a simulated on-chain reward model for DePIN energy nodes.
Each node earns SCH (SunChain Tokens) based on:

Node Uptime: Continuous operation time

Data Accuracy: Correct and verified energy readings

Energy Contribution: Amount of simulated energy reported to the Solana network


Rewards are calculated and distributed through smart contract logic that can be adapted to Solana Mainnet in future versions.

> Note: This demo illustrates how decentralized energy nodes can earn tokenized incentives for powering real-world infrastructure in the DePIN economy.



## MVP / Prototype Stage

The SunChain smart hub meter is currently at the prototype / MVP stage, designed to demonstrate the core concept:

Planned scope: 10 solar units across 3 pilot locations

Supporting 100+ users per hub

AI Agent + IoT integration ready for testing energy tracking, billing, and user management

Demonstrates the feasibility of the system, ready for deployment once funding and hardware expansion are secured


- Note: The system is planned for deployment, not yet live; all functionality is under prototype development and testing.



## Security

On-chain verification of energy data

Escrow-based smart contracts for payment management

External smart contract audit planned before mainnet launch
